# waveprop: Diffraction-based wave propagation simulator with PyTorch support

Python simulator for optical wave propagation based on scalar diffraction theory. Multiple propagation models are 
supported, with the desired propagation distance / complexity determining which one may be best. PyTorch support enables GPU acceleration
and end-to-end training of arbitrary apertures.

## Examples

In the `examples` folder are various scripts demonstrating the features of `waveprop`. It is recommended to run them from the repository root, as shown below.

Note that dimensions `y` corresponds to the first dimension (rows) while `x`
corresponds to the second dimension (columns).

Output images are stored in `outputs` with the current day and timestamp.

### 1. Comparing propagation models

There are three common propagation models: Fraunhofer, Fresnel, and angular spectrum.
Depending on the propagation distance and aperture size, one model may be more appropriate than the other.

The following propagation models are implemented. All make use of the FFT unless otherwise noted. The implementations for Fraunhofer and Fresnel were heavily inspired from the MATLAB scripts for [this book](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/ebooks/PM/Numerical-Simulation-of-Optical-Wave-Propagation-with-Examples-in-MATLAB/eISBN-9780819483270/10.1117/3.866274?SSO=1).

- Fraunhofer: best suited for far-field as it approximates wave-fronts as planar.
- Fresnel (one-step, two-step, multi-step, convolutional): more suitable for near-field as it approximates wave-fronts as parabolic.
- Angular spectrum, with evanescent waves and option to [bandlimit](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-17-22-19662&id=186848). Best suited for very near-field, as it maintains spherical wave-fronts, but more prone to aliasing (which is what bandlimiting can help with).
- Direct integration (no FFT), "brute force" numerical integration, which can be *very* slow, as it directly computes the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld (convolution) integral.
- FFT-DI, linearizes circular convolution of direction integration in the DFT domain as described [here](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/fulltext.cfm?uri=ao-45-6-1102&id=87971). Uses three FFTs, and only practical for small output windows.
- [Shifted Fresnel](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-15-9-5631&id=132698): uses three FFTs to model propagation off of the optical axis with arbitrary input and output sampling.

The following scripts demonstrate the differences between the models, with comparisons to direct integration of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral (computationally expensive).

- `python examples/prop/circ_ap_fraunhofer.py`: simulate circular aperture in Fraunhofer regime, with Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction models.
- `python examples/prop/square_ap_fresnel.py`: simulate square aperture in Fresnel regime, with Fraunhofer, Fresnel, direct integration, and angular spectrum diffraction models.
- `python examples/prop/bl_angular_spectrum.py`: show benefit of band-limiting angular spectrum method.
- `python examples/prop/square_ap_gif.py`: compare various propagation approaches while varying the distance and store as GIF.

### 2. Off-axis, rescaling, and tiling

The (above) standard propagation model have a fixed input and output sampling. The following scripts demonstrate how to simulate off-axis propagation and rescaling. 
This can provide a lot of flexability in simulation.

- `python examples/prop/off_axis.py`: comparing off-axis simulation with Fresnel and bandlimited angular spectrum. In the near-field, shifted Fresnel is not valid.
- `python examples/prop/rescale.py`: comparing off-axis, rescaled simulation with Fresnel and angular spectrum. Shifted Fresnel is not valid in near-field and when rescaling such that output is larger than input (e.g. with `python examples/prop/rescale.py -cn zoom_out`).
- `python examples/prop/tiling.py`: apply rectangular tiling as in [Shifted Fresnel](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-15-9-5631&id=132698) for increasing the resolution at the target/propagated plane. Show how Fresnel is not valid for near-field, while angular spectrum is.

The relevant papers are:

- [Shifted Fresnel diffraction for computational holography (2007)](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-15-9-5631&id=132698)
- [Shifted angular spectrum method for off-axis numerical propagation (2010)](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-18-17-18453&id=205150)
- [Band-limited angular spectrum numerical propagation method with selective scaling of observation window size and sample number (2012)](https://opg.optica.org/josaa/fulltext.cfm?uri=josaa-29-11-2415&id=244612).

### 3. Polychromatic simulation

The above scripts demonstrate monochromatic simulation. The following example shows how to simulate polychromatic light, i.e. with multiple wavelengths.

- `python examples/prop/square_ap_poly.py`: polychromatic simulation of square aperture.
- `python examples/prop/square_ap_poly_gif.py`: polychromatic simulation of square aperture while varying the distance. Acceleration with GPU (via PyTorch) and parallelization (via joblib) is demonstrated.


### 4. PyTorch support

The following propagation models have PyTorch support, meaning a PyTorch tensor can be used as input and output. This is useful for GPU acceleration and for backpropagation:

- Fresnel (convolutional)
- Angular spectrum method

`python examples/prop/square_ap_poly.py use_cuda=True` will run the polychromatic simulation with GPU acceleration.


### 5. Spatial light modulator (TODO)

- `python examples/slm/coherent_amplitude.py`: coherent illumination (single wavelength) simulation of amplitude SLM.

- polychromatric simulation of amplitude SLM with or without deadspace.
- `adafruit_slm_mono_pytorch.py`: monochromatric simulation of amplitude SLM with PyTorch support.

### 6. Holography (TODO)

The above GIF showing the propagation of a holography pattern was generated with the following command:

```
python examples/holography.py --target data/lcav.png --invert
```

The file path can be set to any local path, however the target will be reshaped to a square.

If only interested in the holography pattern at a single distance, e.g. the focal plane, the following command can be run, which will produce a GIF with a single image

```
python examples/holography.py --target data/lcav.png --invert --f_lens 0.5 --z_start 0.5 --nz 1
```



Scripts and functions to simulate free-space optical propagation. 

In the `examples` folder:
- `holography.py`: determing phase pattern for holography and propagating over distances with angular spectrum method.

## Literature and references

Fraunhofer and Fresnel numerical approaches come from the textbook ["Numerical Simulation of Optical 
Wave Propagation with Examples in MATLAB" (2010)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/ebooks/PM/Numerical-Simulation-of-Optical-Wave-Propagation-with-Examples-in-MATLAB/eISBN-9780819483270/10.1117/3.866274?SSO=1).
It is a very nicely-written book with code examples that are easy to follow. 

A more rigorous treatment and derivation of Fraunhofer and Fresnel approximations analytic 
expressions, and conditions can be found in the following textbooks (we reference the following
versions in the docstrings):
- "Introduction to Fourier Optics" by Goodman (Second Edition).
- "Fundamentals of Photonics" by Saleh and Teich (Third Edition).
- "Principles of Optics" by Born and Wolf (Seventh Edition).

A description of the Direct Integration (DI) method and its FFT version can be found in 
["Fast-Fourier-transform based numerical integration method for the Rayleighâ€“Sommerfeld diffraction 
formula" (2006)](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/fulltext.cfm?uri=ao-45-6-1102&id=87971). This 
serves as a good baseline as it is an approximation of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral 
via a Riemann sum (Eq 9). Main drawbacks are computational load, as DI directly performs the 
discrete convolution and FFT-DI requires three FFTs. Moreover, FFT-DI is only practical for small
output windows.

The angular spectrum (AS) approach is another well-known formulation that is directly derived from 
the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld equation. However, it tends to have issues outside of the scenarios of
small apertures and in the near-field. ["Band-Limited Angular Spectrum Method for
Numerical Simulation of Free-Space Propagation in Far and Near Fields"](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-17-22-19662&id=186848)
offers a solution to this problem by limiting the bandwidth of the propagation field. An 
implementation of this approach has been largely replicated from [the code](https://github.com/computational-imaging/neural-holography/blob/d2e399014aa80844edffd98bca34d2df80a69c84/propagation_ASM.py#L22)
of ["Neural holography with camera-in-the-loop training"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3414685.3417802). 
Their index-to-frequency mapping and FFT shifting seemed to be off, and they did not include evanescent waves; both of which were modified for the implementation found here.

Shifted Fresnel allows for the simulation off of the optical-axis and for arbitrary input and output
sampling. A description of this approach can be found in ["Shifted Fresnel diffraction for 
computational holography"](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-15-9-5631&id=132698).

    - https://www.osapublishing.org/josa/fulltext.cfm?uri=josa-59-3-293&id=53644
- Double slit

Analytic forms of (see Born book):
- Fresnel circular aperture
- Fresnel rectangular aperture
